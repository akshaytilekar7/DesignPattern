/*

abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.
abstract method is always public.
abstract and interface

class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override
interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it
class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces.
An abstract member cannot be static or private.
abstract method cannot be marked virtual

interface means a contract to interact with multiple code modules.
interface in WCF interfaces to define Service Contracts.

== is the identity test. 
It will return true if the two objects being tested are in fact the same object. 

Equals() performs an equality test, and will return true 
if the two objects consider themselves equal.


Identity testing is faster,
