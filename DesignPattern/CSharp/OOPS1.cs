/*


object
    two terms: attributes and behaviors
    both data and behavior.

    Data Hiding
        -   Restricting access to certain attributes and/or methods is called data hiding.

procedural/structured design
    the attributes and behaviors are normally separated.

    problem 
        -   data is global, we can modify data that is outside
            the scope of your code.
            or
            multiple functions may have access to the global data
        -   no control over who has access to the data so test debug is hard
        -   but in OO, there is no global data in an OO model
        -   OO has control access to members of an object
