/*

abstraction 
    -   solve problem at design level (outer look of mobile, display, keypad)
    -   hide unwanted data and gives relevant data
    -   focus on what object does rather that how it does
    -   essential characteristics for a set of objects

encapsulation

    -   solve problem at implementation level (inner implementation how keypad works)
    -   hide code : fun , protect data from outside world
    -   how object does things

     Encapsulation is the internal circuits, battery, etc., 
     that combine to make it a calculator. 
     
     Abstraction is the different buttons like on-off, clear and 
     other buttons provided to operate it.
