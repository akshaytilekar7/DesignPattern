/*

abstraction 
    -   solve problem at design level (outer look of mobile, display, keypad)
    -   hide unwanted data and gives relevant data
    -   focus on what object does rather that how it does
    -   essential characteristics for a set of objects

encapsulation

    -   solve problem at implementation level (inner implementation how keypad works)
    -   hide code : fun , protect data from outside world
    -   how object does things

     Encapsulation is the internal circuits, battery, etc., 
     that combine to make it a calculator. 
     
     Abstraction is the different buttons like on-off, clear and 
     other buttons provided to operate it.

/*


object
    two terms: attributes and behaviors
    both data and behavior.

    Data Hiding
        -   Restricting access to certain attributes and/or methods is called data hiding.

procedural/structured design
    the attributes and behaviors are normally separated.

    problem 
        -   data is global, we can modify data that is outside
            the scope of your code.
            or
            multiple functions may have access to the global data
        -   no control over who has access to the data so test debug is hard
        -   but in OO, there is no global data in an OO model
        -   OO has control access to members of an object
