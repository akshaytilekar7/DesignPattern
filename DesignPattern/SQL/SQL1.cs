/*

function must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional.
Even a procedure can return zero or n values.

Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas 
Procedures can have input or output parameters.

Functions can be called from Procedure whereas 
Procedures cannot be called from a Function.

The procedure allows SELECT as well as DML(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statement in it whereas
Function allows only SELECT statement in it.

An exception can be handled by try-catch block in a Procedure whereas 
try-catch block cannot be used in a Function.

We can use Transactions in Procedure whereas
we can't use Transactions in Function

The having clause works on aggregated data.
