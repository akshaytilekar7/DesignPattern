why I was interested in      and what social justice meant to me, very laid back.
3 pillars of TW were

"what would you do as president of the world
They ask about social and economic justice.  
Social justice topic you are passionate about? 

Can u describe a form of social or economic injustice where you live? 

    Economic justice is the idea that the economy will be more successful if it is fairer.
    The goal is to create opportunities for all to thrive and that prosperity and justice 
        go hand-in-hand rather than in opposition to one another.
    Universal basic income, income equality by gender and race, equal opportunity for employment and credit, 
        and allowing all to reach their full potential are all tenets of economic justice.

why I want to join TW,

What is social justice to me, how do I relate design to social justice,
why am I a good fit for Thought-works, examples of work where I've tackled such questions.  

hey asked some behavioral interview questions, then asked about social justice and ThoughtWorks' 3 pillars.
Be prepared to talk about the pillars,
social justice, oppression(अत्याचार), things like that. They also asked my salary expectations. 

Who would you consider to be oppressed?
