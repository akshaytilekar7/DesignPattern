Scrum is a subset of Agile

we work in scrum 
LeSS (large scale Scrum)
    a single Product Backlog (because it’s for a product, not a team),
    one Definition of Done for all teams,
    one Potentially Shippable Product Increment at the end of each Sprint,
    one Product Owner,
    many complete, cross-functional teams (with no single-specialist teams),
    one Sprint.

XP :
        The two people work together to design, code and test user stories. 
        Ideally, the two people would be equally skilled and would each have equal time at the keyboard.

Feature
    :   Cross-component, cross-functional,
    :   Team structure fixes all these problems and also introduces some changes
    :   Feature   : Responsible for the whole customer-centric feature	
        Component : Responsible for only part of a customer-centric feature
        Shared team responsibilities	Definite individual responsibilities
        multiple specializations	Targets on single specialization
        maximum customer value	Delivers a maximum number of lines of code

DOD
    -   is it following all AC
    -   design should be as per sketches
    -   it should be working on dev env
    -   addressed to all Code reviewed?
    -   does all unit test should be passed
    -   some team member has to test that story (cross testing)
    -   finally after end of sprint : present that story to stakeholder 
    -   in some cases we also do pre demo only for PO
    -   shippable to release
